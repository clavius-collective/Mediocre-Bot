Mediocre-Bot
============

An IRC bot that does not suck. Well, mostly....

To do
-----

The code currently works but does not do very much. The following are to be implemented before it should go live for people to add stuff to.

1. User and channel tracking in memory.
2. Persistent data storage service, primarily for arbitrary user data.
3. Documentation and clean up of modules.
4. Module to handle simple command based interactions.
